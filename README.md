# Express PostgreSQL CRUD

Created Express App for organizing music albums. Was for practicing pair programming with a hard EOD deadline to build this app out. 

Used Express, Knex, PostgreSQL, and Jade to get the job done.

Poorly named as "Mystery" because it was a mystery to us what we were going to be coding for the exercise.
